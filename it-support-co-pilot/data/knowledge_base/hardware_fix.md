# Standard Laptop Hardware Troubleshooting

## Mouse/Trackpad Not Responding

1. **Check USB/Wireless Connection:** Ensure the mouse is properly plugged in or that the wireless dongle is connected and the battery is charged.
2. **Reboot the Laptop:** A full system restart often resolves driver conflicts.
3. **Driver Update (Advanced):** If the above fail, open Device Manager, find "Mice and other pointing devices," right-click your mouse, and select "Update driver."

## Keyboard Keys Not Working

If individual keys fail, check for physical debris. If the entire keyboard is non-responsive, check if the laptop is in "Tablet Mode" or if external input devices are interfering.
