# VPN Access Troubleshooting (Singapore Region)

## Common Error: "Authentication Failed"

If your VPN connection fails with this error, it usually means your Active Directory password is expired or locked.
**Resolution Steps:**
1. Open the Password Reset Portal (internal link) on a mobile device or separate network.
2. If you cannot reset it, the Resolver Agent should automatically trigger a request to the Access Management Team.

## Slow Connection Speed

1. **Change Server Location:** Switch from the default `SG-Primary` server to `SG-Secondary`.
2. **Check Local Network:** Try a wired connection to eliminate local WiFi issues.
